Signal K plugin for audio notifications
=================================

This plugin plays user configurable sounds and/or text to speech when a Signal K notification enters emergency/alarm/warn/notice state.

Audio notification is configurable to repeat continuously or output a one time notification sound/speech when the notification state changes.
All notifications are queued in order and play the sound first followed by a message if available, repeating as configured.

Each state's (emergency/alarm/warn/notice) playback can be configure independently with the option to create custom playback rules for a specifica path & state.
Custom commands can be initiated before and after a continuous notification plays (eg. pause music, change volume).


Example usage: a zone for a elevated coolant or alternator temperature could trigger a single play/speech event while an overheat zone would send a continuous output/alarm.  A similar setup could be used for depth or battery SOC.  An anchor alarm would be customized to play continously, perhaps with a unique attention grabbing sound.

Background: a zone and its corresponding notification method can be defined using plugins like @signalk/zones or generated by signalk-anchoralarm-plugin.  When a Signal K path (eg. environment.depth.belowSurface) enters a specified value range (zone) an associated notification would be generated which would in turn could trigger this plugin.  Webapps like KIP can be used to silence or resolve active notifications.  (note: currently if using KIP @signalk/zones entries should not be defined as 'Active')
