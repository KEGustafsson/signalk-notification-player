Signal K plugin for audio notifications
=================================

This plugin plays user configurable sounds and/or text to speech when a Signal K notification enters emergency/alarm/warn/notice state.

Audio notification is configurable to repeat continuously or output a one time notification sound/speech when the notification state changes.
All notifications are queued in order and play the sound first followed by a message if available, repeating as configured.  Continuous playback stops when a notification's state returns to 'normal' or 'sound' is removed from its method (muted/silenced).


The playback for each state (emergency/alarm/warn/notice) in a notification can be configure independently with the option to create custom playback rules for a specifica path & state.  Custom commands can be initiated before and after a notification plays (eg. pause music, change volume, flash lights).

Example usage: a zone for a elevated coolant or alternator temperature could trigger a single play/speech event while an overheat zone would send a continuous output/alarm.  A similar setup could be used for depth or battery SOC.  An anchor alarm would be customized to play continously, perhaps with a unique attention grabbing sound.

### Background
A Signal K path can have one or more zones associated with it. Zones are specified in a path's meta data which can be defined/edited using SK Data Browser /w Meta Data enabled, or generated by plugins like signalk-anchoralarm-plugin.
When a Signal K path's value (eg. environment.depth.belowSurface = 3) enters the range specified in a zone, its associated notification's state is updated, which could trigger this plugin to play an audio notification/text to speech.
Webapps like KIP can be used to silence or resolve active notifications.  (note: Zoned defined by the older @signalk/zones plugin has issues with KIP if entries are 'Active'. To migrate zone configuration from @signalk/zones plugin to use SK server directly, click edit and then save for each path with a zone shown under SK Data Browser. Then disable then @signalk/zones plugin.)
